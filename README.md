Project Euler
==============

projecteuler.net

Project Euler is a small website dedicated to creating mind bending puzzles for users to practice the fundamentals of Mathemtics and programming at the same time. Each task gets progressively harder and forces people to learn more about the language they are using.

As a programmer, the website allows for anyone with even the most basic knowledge about any programming language to practice on the website, the only requirement is dedication to the task at hand.

What can it be used for
--------------
If you need to learn a new language for programming this is especially helpful, and even better if you've done some of the challenges before in another language. I have personally found this useful as I am unable to constantly produce difficult challenges for myself as an amateur programmer trying to learn a new language and I refer it to anyone who asks me for any tips in learning a new language.

What I've used
--------------
I've done my projects in Java and Python mainly using IDEs provided by JetBrains to practice learning the languages and get to know the fundamentals. Although I may deviate from using Project Euler in the future as my knowledge increases and I begin to search for harder challenges, if any challenge was completed in a language that is not listed, I shall add it in its own corresponding folder.
